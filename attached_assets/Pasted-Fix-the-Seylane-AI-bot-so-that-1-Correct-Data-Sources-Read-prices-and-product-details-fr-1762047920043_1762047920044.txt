Fix the Seylane AI bot so that:

1. **Correct Data Sources**
   - Read prices and product details from `data/products.csv`.
   - Read product URLs (slugs) from `data/product_slugs.csv`.
   - Both files are UTF-8 encoded Persian CSVs.
   - products.csv includes fields like name, brand, category, price.
   - product_slugs.csv includes fields like name and product_url.

2. **Logic Fix**
   - When a product name (Persian or English) is mentioned:
     - Find the exact match in products.csv by name (normalize Persian characters like ك→ک, ي→ی).
     - Get its price and brand.
     - Then look up the same product name in product_slugs.csv to get the correct `product_url`.
     - If no exact match in slugs, try brand+name similarity.

3. **Link Format**
   - The final URL should come directly from product_slugs.csv — **do not build fake URLs**.
   - All links must use domain `https://luxirana.com`.

4. **Price Calculation**
   - Show price from products.csv.
   - Also show discounted price (40% off).
   - Use Persian digits with `Intl.NumberFormat('fa-IR')`.

5. **Reply Format (in Persian)**
   - If product found:
     ```
     پیدا شد 😍  
     🛍️ [name]  
     💰 قیمت مصرف‌کننده: [price] تومان  
     برای شما با ۴۰٪ تخفیف: [discountPrice] تومان  
     ✨ برند: [brand]  
     لینک خرید 👇  
     [product_url]
     ```
   - If not found:
     ```
     فعلاً اون مدل رو موجود نداریم ولی چندتا مشابه دارم، میخوای ببینی؟ 😊
     ```
   - Never respond with “نمی‌دونم” or “خطا”.

6. **Improved Matching**
   - Match both Persian and English.
   - Handle partial matches and similar names (fuzzy search).
   - If no exact match, show up to 3 similar products with names and links.

7. **Data Debug**
   - Log to console the exact product name, price, and link used.
   - If lookup fails, log clearly which file didn’t have a match.

8. **Continuous Check**
   - Keep checking for new messages every few seconds and handle replies continuously.

Once fixed, show me:
- The updated search_product.js and get_product_link.js
- And one sample console output for a known product (with correct price and link from luxirana.com)
