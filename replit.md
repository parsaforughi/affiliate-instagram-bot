## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The bot adopts a warm, friendly, and conversational Persian tone (محاوره‌ای), utilizing natural emoji usage and avoiding formal language. Responses are formatted as short bullet points to enhance readability and conciseness, always ending with an engaging question to encourage further interaction.

### Technical Implementations
- **Human-like AI**: Employs an emotionally intelligent prompt for natural, confident, and engaging interactions, including handling rude messages playfully.
- **Context Management**: The bot maintains conversation context by considering the last 2 user messages and 1 bot reply, enabling natural follow-up conversations.
- **Product Search & Filtering**:
    - Strict filtering for 6 primary brands: Collamin, Misswake, IceBall, Dafi, Umbrella, Pixel.
    - Smart best-seller suggestions are provided only when explicitly requested.
    - When an exact product isn't found, the AI suggests alternatives based on brand, category, or popular products.
- **Pricing & Discounts**: Always displays the consumer price first, followed by a 40% discounted price specifically for affiliates, using Persian numbers and separators.
- **Performance Optimization**: Critical optimizations include removing automatic product injection into the system prompt and reducing the context window sent to OpenAI, drastically improving response times.
- **Robust Data Handling**: Features include Persian character and number normalization for accurate searching, a robust CSV parser for product data, and a 3-tier matching logic for product search (exact name, exact brand, fuzzy matching).
- **Atomic Responses**: Ensures multiple AI responses are merged into a single outgoing message.
- **Affiliate Program Integration**: Provides a structured, 4-step explanation for joining the affiliate program and directs users to the affiliate login panel.

### Feature Specifications
- **Affiliate Offer Flow**: 
  - When users ask "افر همکاری شما چیه؟" or similar, bot explains 40% discount offer with code "onlineshops" and free shipping
  - Offers custom discount code with user's brand name
  - If user responds positively ("بله", "آره", "می‌خوام"), sends 4-step affiliate registration guide + link
- **Affiliate Onboarding**: Guides users through the affiliate program registration.

- **Best Seller Identification**: Highlights best-selling products for each brand upon request.
- **Payment Information**: Explains payment methods and commission withdrawal from the affiliate account.

### System Design Choices
- **Core Files**: `main.js` for main logic, Instagram automation, and OpenAI integration; `search_product.js` for product search and URL lookup; `get_product_link.js` for slug URL resolution; `message_cache.json` for avoiding duplicate processing; `user_contexts.json` for user conversation history; `products.csv` and `product_slugs.csv` for product data and URLs.
- **Deployment**: Utilizes an "Instagram Bot" workflow running `node main.js`, with auto-restart on package or module changes, and a 12-second polling interval for new messages.
